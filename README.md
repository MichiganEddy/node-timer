# node-timer
A simple terminal based countdown timer.

Run the timer:
(Supposing NPM and Node are installed)
Clone the repo on your local machine.
Use `npm build` to compile to JavaScript.
Use `npm start` to run the timer.

This has not been tested on anything other than Ubuntu 14.14, so no guarantees it works.
